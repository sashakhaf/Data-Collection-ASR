# Data-Collection-ASR

  I collected texts tokenized by sentences in my native language which is Wolof from Laurent Besacier work available in this      linkÂ https://github.com/sashakhaf/ALFFA_PUBLIC/blob/master/ASR/WOLOF/LM/WOL.txt. I made recording of the text by using Lig-Aikuma application in the ellicitation   mode.

  I divided the text into 40 sessions of 50 sentences each from the WOL.txt, each session being a simple text file. I made 40 recordings and then divided them into a training and a test of one hour each. The DevSet contains 1050 audios of 1h:2mn46sec and the testSet also contains 950 audios of 1h:2mn11sec, the folder Transcripts contains the corresponding text for Dev and the Test. We have additionally the metadata of the recordings for the Dev and the Test.
During the recording, some sentences were not easy to read, and sometimes when the sentences were too long, the application was not able to record the whole sentence. To read them we increased the playback speed in order to record the whole sentence.
